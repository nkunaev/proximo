"""Proximo MCP server.

Exposes Proxmox management (REST API) and in-container exec (ssh+pct) as MCP tools.

Verified 2026-06-07 against the official `mcp` Python SDK (FastMCP): import path,
`@mcp.tool()` decorator, type-hinted params, and dict returns are current (v1.x).

Ethical spine:
- In-container exec (ct_*) is OFF by default — API-only is the safe default; enable with PROXIMO_ENABLE_EXEC.
- Every tool call is audited *with its real outcome* (errors recorded, not assumed "ok").
- Every mutating tool is confirm-gated — all of them, across every plane, not a named
  few (structurally enforced by test_server_plan.py::test_every_mutating_tool_is_confirm_gated).
- The CTID allowlist is enforced fail-closed in the exec backend.
- Secrets are never read or logged here.

# 555 -> 665 tokens, a 20% regression on the figure the README publishes. Pinned by
# tests/test_schema_budget.py, which is why it was caught rather than shipped.)

# Why it exists: scoping changes what is ADVERTISED; it must never change what is REACHABLE.
# Four layers prune the registry and every one of them could otherwise strand a working tool on
# every transport with no recovery inside a live session.
#
# Why a tool for an unconfigured plane is still reachable rather than hidden: it fails with its

# are resident, so an agent naming a real tool directly, or fabricating a verb-order variant, lands
# exactly here. A dead-end error is what makes an agent fabricate the NEXT wrong name; give it a
# recoverable pointer instead. Per major: on 1.x, re-registering the CallToolRequest handler below
# is last-write-wins over FastMCP's own (resident tools still dispatch through FastMCP's original
# handler unchanged). On 2.x the same WIRE outcome is built into the server at construction —
# _mcpcompat.make_server returns a subclass whose public call_tool override raises the pointer for
# non-resident names (the wire's _handle_call_tool awaits that public method), so there is nothing
# to re-register here. The IN-PROCESS mcp.call_tool differs by major for non-residents (1.x: the
