"""Content-trust taint — the foundation of Proximo's prompt-injection mitigation.

Design: `.scratch/taint-design-v2-2026-07-02.md`. **Wired live:** classification + marker
primitives live in this module; `server.py` calls `mark_tainted` from `_audited()`'s
adversarial-read hook and from `pve_agent_exec`'s own fail-closed guard; `is_tainted` is
consulted by `envelope.py`'s `enforce_envelope_forbid` (taint -> forbid coupling) and
`consent.py`'s `enforce_consent` (taint -> consent coupling); the advisory fence wrapper
`fence_output` labels adversarial returns as data-not-instructions (a courtesy to the model,
not a control). Server integration is active — the taint marker is set, read, and enforced as
configured. **`capture_adversarial_current`** (Component 4, added for the Wave 6b adversarial
review's Finding 1, 2026-07-16) is the second wiring point: a plan factory's own embedded
CAPTURE read of an ADVERSARIAL-classified list tool (called directly against the backend,
bypassing `_audited()` entirely) marks taint and stamps `Plan.current` the same way a live call
to the wrapped read tool would — `proximo/ceph.py`'s 6 mon/mgr/mds create/destroy plan factories
are its first callers. Wave 6c (2026-07-16) extended the helper with an optional `finder=`
callable so a CAPTURE source whose read returns a NESTED shape (not a flat list) — the OSD CRUSH
tree — can plug in its own lookup without changing the flat-list default for every existing
caller; `proximo/ceph.py`'s OSD destroy/in/out plan factories are its first `finder` callers.
Wave 6d (2026-07-16) shipped `pve_ceph_pool_list`/`pve_ceph_pool_status`/`pve_ceph_fs_list` as
REVIEWED_TRUSTED, using plain try/except CAPTURE; the Wave 6d adversarial review (2026-07-17,
Finding 1) REVERSED that ruling to ADVERSARIAL (see `ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS`'s own entry comment below
for the corrected argument), so `proximo/ceph.py`'s 5 pool/fs create/set/destroy plan factories
were rewired onto this same helper too. `plan_ceph_pool_set`'s CAPTURE source
(`ceph_pool_status`) is this function's first caller whose `read()` returns a bare dict rather
than a list -- its `finder` returns that dict unchanged (ignoring `match_id` entirely) instead of
searching a collection, the same "identity finder" shape any future single-object CAPTURE source
can reuse.

**Classification is by CHANNEL, not read-vs-mutation.** `ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS` is a curated set of
tool names whose RETURN carries guest- or externally-authored bytes an attacker can shape: guest
shell/DB/log output, quarantined-email content, free-text config/log fields. Some of these tools
are themselves mutations (`ct_exec`, `ct_psql`, `pve_agent_exec`) — classification here is about
what the RESPONSE carries back into the calling agent's context, not whether the call mutates.

**The taint marker is FILE-BACKED and STICKY, beside the audit ledger** (mirrors `contain.py`'s
out-of-band trip file): `<audit_dir>/.proximo-taint/tainted`, fresh-`os.stat`'d on every read, no
caching, no process-global/ContextVar state (the family's "no process state" invariant — a
ContextVar under-tracks across the read-now/mutate-later gap and has restart amnesia the wrong
way, silently un-tainting instead of fail-closed). Once set, taint clears ONLY out-of-band: no
`@mcp.tool()` clears it (see the module docstring's "Clearing taint" note below) — a consumed
consent grant does NOT clear it either (a hijacked agent could otherwise script a sacrificial
benign mutation, get it approved, and launder the session's taint before a different
un-consented malicious plan runs).

Fail-closed invariants (consistent with the gate family — `contain.py`, `envelope.py`):

1. All taint env unset => inert, zero behavior change. `taint_tracking_on()`/`fence_on()`/
   `require_consent_when_tainted()` are the only entry points that read env; nothing else in this
   module consults env.
2. Marker read (`is_tainted`): `FileNotFoundError` => False (clean, mirrors `contain_state()`);
   ANY other `OSError`/`ValueError` => True (fail-closed, TAINTED). No caching — every call
   restats.
3. A corrupt/unreadable existing marker can never UN-taint: `is_tainted()` only stats for
   presence and never parses content, and `mark_tainted()` over a corrupt file starts the
   JSON payload fresh rather than crashing (the source history since the last legible marker is
   lost, but the marker stays present throughout).
4. `mark_tainted()` refuses (raises `OSError`) rather than follows a symlinked `.proximo-taint`
   directory — mirrors `envelope.py`'s symlinked reservation-directory refusal.
5. `taint_forbid_set()`'s garbled shape handling matches `envelope._parse_forbid` exactly: an
   unparseable `PROXIMO_TAINT_FORBID` shape returns `garbled=True` so a caller (the taint->forbid
   coupling, a later stage) can collapse to forbid-all — the same "garbled shape => fail-closed"
   posture `envelope.py` already uses for `PROXIMO_FORBID`.
6. No `@mcp.tool()` clears taint. `clear_taint()` is the out-of-band primitive an operator-side
   helper script (and tests) call directly, the same trust boundary as CONTAIN's arm/disarm and
   the consent grant directory — never wired to a tool (a later stage's structural test asserts
   this at the server layer).

HONEST LIMITS (ship verbatim in SECURITY.md / any future doc referencing this module — no
overclaim):

- Fence (`fence()`/`fence_output()`) is advisory only: it sandwiches untrusted content in a
  clearly-labeled envelope, but a hijacked agent can simply ignore the warning and act on the
  content anyway. It does not, and cannot, force the calling model to treat `data` as inert.
- The taint marker is a real boundary only when `.proximo-taint`'s parent directory sits OUTSIDE
  the agent's own write reach — the same write-boundary precondition every gate in this family
  documents (`envelope.py`'s rate wall, `consent.py`'s grant dir). Co-located (the agent shares a
  filesystem with the marker), a compromised agent can `rm -rf .proximo-taint` and silently
  un-taint itself — a speed-bump and an observability signal, not a guarantee. CONTAIN's
  out-of-band kill-switch is the real backstop for a co-located deployment.
- The file marker SURVIVES a process restart (it is on disk, not process memory) — a co-located
  agent cannot clear its taint by bouncing the server; it must actively `rm` the marker, which is
  the same co-located write-reach limit above. (This is deliberately stronger than a process-global
  marker, which a restart WOULD reset.) The marker is NOT tamper-evident, though: a ledger-derived,
  tamper-evident taint signal is a stronger FUTURE form (see the design doc), not what's built here.
- Classification (`ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS`) is a curated set. An adversarial channel that isn't
  classified is a real gap; a later stage's completeness test makes an UNCLASSIFIED tool fail CI
  (not fail-open at runtime), but a tool that's classified WRONG (marked trusted when it actually
  carries guest/external bytes) is a residual gap this module cannot self-detect. Bias
  conservative: classify as adversarial when unsure.

    """CAPTURE-or-declare for a plan factory whose backing read is classified ADVERSARIAL
    (`ADVERSARIAL_TOOLS`) but is called directly against the backend inside the plan factory —
    bypassing the wrapped read tool, and therefore `_audited()`'s own taint-marking / ledger-
    stamping / fence wiring, entirely (a plan factory calls `api.<method>()` directly, never the
    tool). Wave 6b adversarial review Finding 1 (2026-07-16): the 6 Ceph mon/mgr/mds
    create/destroy plan factories fetch the SAME daemon-self-reported content that made
    `pve_ceph_{mon,mgr,mds}_list` ADVERSARIAL, and the captured entry landed straight in
    `Plan.current` (and the ledger's "planned" entry) with no taint marker set and no provenance
    stamp at all — this is the single shared home for that shape (a plan factory that
    best-effort-reads something and looks up one entry by id). NOT wired into `config_edit.py`'s
    `plan_config_set` (a single-GET CAPTURE, a different shape — logged as separate campaign
    debt by the review, out of scope for this fix).

    Mirrors `_audited()`'s taint handling for a full tool call, so a plan factory's embedded
    CAPTURE produces the SAME marker/ledger state a direct call to the wrapped read tool would
    have produced:

    - Marks the sticky marker (`mark_tainted(audit_dir, source)`) BEFORE `read()` runs, gated on
      the identical `is_adversarial(source) and taint_tracking_on()` condition and the identical
      ordering `_audited()` uses — so a read that raises still taints (an error body can carry
      attacker-shaped content too). A `mark_tainted()` failure is left to propagate: the plan
      factory runs inside `server._plan()`, whose own exception handling already records the
      failed build to the ledger and re-raises — the same fail-closed backstop `_audited()`
      provides for a live tool call, no separate handling needed here.
    - Reads the source (best-effort) and finds the one matching entry. By DEFAULT (`finder=None`)
      this is the original flat-list lookup: the entry whose `key` field equals `match_id` inside
      a `list[dict]` — UNCHANGED behavior for every pre-existing caller (the 6 Wave 6b mon/mgr/
      mds create/destroy factories), which pass neither `finder` nor a non-default `key` shape.
      When `finder` IS given, it REPLACES that lookup entirely: `finder(result, match_id)` must
      return the matching entry dict (or a falsy value for "no match", treated identically to the
      flat-list default's own "no match" case — NOT a failure). Wave 6c's OSD destroy/in/out
      CAPTURE (`proximo/ceph.py`) is the first `finder` caller: `pve_ceph_osd_tree` is
      ADVERSARIAL (same daemon-self-report channel as mon/mgr/mds list) but its
      GET /nodes/{node}/ceph/osd response is a single NESTED object (root CRUSH bucket ->
      children -> ... -> OSD leaves), not a flat list — the default `key`-equality lookup over
      `list[dict]` cannot walk that shape. `proximo/ceph.py`'s `_find_osd_in_tree` is passed as
      `finder` instead of changing this function's default behavior for every other caller.
      A successful read with no match (default OR `finder` path) degrades to `current={}`
      (expected — e.g. a create's target doesn't exist yet), NOT a failure — only a raised
      exception returns `ok=False` (the caller degrades to `complete=False`, the pre-existing
      CAPTURE-or-declare contract, UNCHANGED by this helper or its extension). `read()` and the
      `finder(result, match_id)` call live in the SAME `try/except Exception` block (Wave 6c
      review Finding 2, MINOR, 2026-07-16 fix): a raising `finder` degrades exactly like a
      raising `read()` — it does NOT propagate uncaught. `_find_osd_in_tree` cannot itself raise
      for any input shape (isinstance-checked at every level, `return {}` on anything malformed),
      so this was not exploitable through Wave 6c's own caller, but the generic mechanism this
      function advertises ("a `finder` returning a falsy non-dict is normalized the same as
      `{}`") did not extend to "a raising `finder`" before this fix — any FUTURE `finder=` caller
      now inherits the same fail-open guarantee `read()` always had.
    - On a successful read (`ok=True`), the returned `current` dict is stamped with the SAME
      untrusted-content annotation `_audited()`/`_untrusted_detail` apply to ledger `detail`
      (`{"untrusted": True, "content_trust": "adversarial"}`), under the identical
      is_adversarial+taint_tracking_on gate — inert (byte-for-byte unchanged dict) otherwise,
      matching `_untrusted_detail`'s own fail-open-to-unchanged default. Because
      `server._record_plan()` writes `Plan.current` verbatim into the ledger's "planned" detail
      dict, stamping here is sufficient for the stamp to reach BOTH the dry-run response the
      calling agent sees AND the tamper-evident ledger — no separate ledger-side call needed. On
      a failed read (`ok=False`) the returned `{}` is NOT stamped — nothing was actually
      captured, matching the pre-existing "no capture" shape exactly.
