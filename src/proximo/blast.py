"""Blast-radius engine — compute the SPECIFIC downstream impact of a dangerous op.

The pure reasoning (compute_storage_blast and its helpers) takes already-fetched cluster
state and returns named, classified consequences — no api, no I/O, fully unit-testable.
gather_storage_dependents does the safe reads and CATCHES per-guest failures (turning them
into complete=False, never raising) so the plan always builds with an honest INCOMPLETE marker.

Honesty contract (mirrors the access-plane plan_*_delete idiom):
- An incomplete enumeration is rendered LOUDLY and never read as "nothing affected = safe".
- The engine never lowers a plan's risk; on uncertainty it forces max_severity="high".
- "found zero affected" is not a safety signal — orphaned/unreferenced volumes are out of v1 scope.
