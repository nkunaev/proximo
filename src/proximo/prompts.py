"""Safe-runbook MCP prompts — user-invoked front doors for common Proxmox
operations. Each prompt returns a plain-language runbook that steers the agent
down Proximo's guarded path: check capacity, PLAN before you mutate, verify
after, and keep the receipts. Prompts are templates, not tool-callers — they add
no new authority; they lower the "where do I start" barrier and point at the safe
sequence the trust spine already enforces.

Registered on the shared FastMCP instance the same way the tool wrappers are
(import proximo.server, decorate on its `mcp`); server.py imports this module at
the bottom for the registration side effect.
