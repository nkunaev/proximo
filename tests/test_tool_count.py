"""Pin the MCP tool surface count so doc/count drift can't recur.

History: a session once chased a phantom "145 vs 146" discrepancy. The 146 was a
`grep -c '@mcp.tool()'` artifact — it counted the prose mention of `@mcp.tool()` in
server.py's module docstring as if it were a decorator. The authoritative count is the
FastMCP registry (`mcp.list_tools()`), which dedupes by tool name. This test makes the
number machine-checked: bump EXPECTED_TOOL_COUNT *intentionally* when you add/remove a
tool (same discipline as the version), never let it drift silently.

The second test catches a real bug: if two functions register under the same tool name,
the registry silently keeps one and drops the other (a "lost tool"). That shows up as
real-decorators > registry-entries — so we count the actual decorator LINES (anchored to
line-start, which excludes docstring/comment mentions) and require them to equal the
exposed surface. The equality also proves no decorator is env-gated (e.g. an exec-mode
tool behind a flag) — a conditional one would make the unconditional source count exceed
the runtime count.

Decorator lines are counted across server.py AND every per-plane submodule under
`proximo/tools/` (2026-07-02 split): server.py keeps the mutation funnel (mcp, tool, the
5-gate wiring) plus the three manual-audit-path exec tools, while the ~348 thin per-plane
wrappers now live in `proximo/tools/*.py` and are re-imported into server.py by name for
registration + `server.<tool>` surface parity. The registry is still the single source of
truth for the exposed count; this just widens WHERE we look for the source-level decorator
count it's compared against.

# a network_get read when the caller omits it, but (unlike PVE's stricter refusal) forwards an
# explicit caller-supplied type as a genuine change, a builder judgment call since nothing in
# PMG's schema documents type as immutable; (2) the network list `?type=` filter enum
# (any_bridge) DIFFERS from the create/update value enum (unknown) — validated against two
# separate sets; (3) `pmg_node_network_revert` rated LOW here, not the draft's guessed MEDIUM —
# functionally identical to PBS's/PVE's own "safe undo, live config untouched" revert, argued
# not silently overridden; (4) `search` is schema-REQUIRED on DNS write (unlike the existing PVE/
# PBS tools on this codebase, which treat it as optional); (5) PMG's node /config is a narrow
# ACME-only block (acme/acmedomain[n]/digest), not PBS's richer general-settings block at the
# same path; (6) `pmg_node_network_reload`'s bare PUT returns a schema-confirmed STRING (not
# null) — whether it's a UPID or a plain status message is unresolved from schema alone and the
# docstring says so; (7) subscription `key` is defensively stripped on read (schema-thin, echo
# unconfirmed either way, mirrors pbs_config.py's `_strip_password` idiom). Taint: all 19

# 715 after Wave 7d — SDN fabrics, the FINAL chunk of Wave 7, new

# description string. fabric/fabric-node DELETE accept NEITHER digest NOR lock-token — the
# only delete family on the whole SDN plane with zero optimistic-lock support (schema-
# verified). fabric/fabric-node UPDATE require restating `protocol` in the body (unlike
# controller/dns/ipam's own immutable-and-absent `type`). fabric_status_interfaces is
# REVIEWED_TRUSTED (local, not peer-controlled); neighbors/routes are ADVERSARIAL
# (wire-learned FRR-reported content) — see taint.py's own entry comment. This CLOSES Wave 7
# (7a+7b+7c+7d+7e = 12+10+16+15+17 = 70 new tools + 1 signature extension, 645 -> 715).
# Was 700 after Wave 7e — SDN prefix-lists + route-maps, new

# OPAQUE, schema-untyped token — never validated as an integer, unlike route-map's own `order`
# (a properly-typed required integer 0-65535 on all 3 of its methods). Route-maps have NO
# container-level create/update/delete — only entries (the first entry_create for an id
# implicitly creates the route map). No secret-shaped field on this plane (unlike Wave 7c's dns
# key/ipam token) — REVIEWED_TRUSTED throughout. Was 683 after Wave 7c — SDN controllers + DNS +
